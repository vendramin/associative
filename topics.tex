We collect here some other topics for final presentations. Some topics
can also be used as bachelor or master theses.

% \subsection*{Rickart's theorem}

% In Lecture \ref{09} we presented an algebraic proof of Rickart's theorem. 
% The original proof uses analysis; see Appendix \ref{section:Rickart} or \cite[(6.4) of Chapter II]{MR1838439}. 

%\subsection*{Connel's theorem}
%
%In Lecture \ref{11} we presented the statement of Connel's theorem, which
%characterizes prime group rings over fields of characteristic zero 
%(see Theorem \ref{thm:Connel}); the proof of this  
%result appears for example in \cite[Theorem 2.10 of Chapter 4]{MR798076}. 
%As a corollary, one obtains 
%that, if $K$ is a field of characteristic zero,
%then the group ring $K[G]$ is left artinian if and only if the group
%$G$ is finite; see 
%\cite[Theorem 1.1 of Chapter 10]{MR798076} for a proof. 

% \subsection*{Kolchin's theorem}

% Let $U_n(\C)$ be the subgroup of $\GL_n(\C)$ 
% of matrices $(u_{ij})$ such that 
% \[
% u_{ij}=\begin{cases}
% 1&\text{if $i=j$},\\
% 0&\text{if $i>j$}.\end{cases}
% \]

% A matrix $a\in\GL_n(\C)$ is said to be \emph{unipotent} 
% if its characteristic polynomial is of the form $(X-1)^n$. 
% A subgroup $G$ of $\GL_n(\C)$ is said to be \emph{unipotent} if
% each $g\in G$ is unipotent. 

% An important theorem of Kolchin states that 
% every unipotent subgroup of $\GL_n(\C)$ is conjugate
% of some subgroup of $U_n(\C)$. The theorem and its proof 
% appear, for example, 
% in the 
% VUB course \href{https://github.com/vendramin/representation}{Representation theory of algebras}.

\subsection*{The double centralizer theorem}

Let $R$ be a ring. 
The \emph{centralizer} of a subring $S$ of $R$ 
is 
$C_R(S)=\{r\in R: rs=sr\text{ for all $s\in S$}\}$. 
Clearly, $C_R(C_R(S))\supseteq S$, but equality does not always hold. 
The double centralizer theorem give conditions under which one can conclude that the equality occurs; see \cite[Chapter 4]{MR3308118}. 

\subsection*{The Amitsur--Levitzki theorem}

The theorem states that 
if $A$ is a commutative algebra, then 
the matrix algebra 
$M_n(K)$ satisfies the identity 
\[
s_{2n}(a_{1},\dots ,a_{2n})=0,
\]
where 
\[
s_{n}(X_1,\dots,X_n)=\sum_{\sigma\in\Sym_n}\sgn(\sigma)X_{\sigma(1)}\cdots X_{\sigma(n)}.
\]
See \cite[Theorem 6.39]{MR3308118} for the beautiful 
proof found by Rosset. 

\subsection*{Non-commutative Hilbert's basis theorem}

There exists a non-commutative version of the celebrated
Hilbert's basis theorem. It is based on the theory of Ore's extensions (also known as \emph{skew polynomial rings}). The theorem
appears in \cite[I.8.3]{MR1321145}; see \cite[I.7]{MR1321145} 
for the basic theory of Ore's extensions. 

\subsection*{The Golod--Shafarevich theorem}

This is an important theorem of non-commutative algebra
with several interesting applications, for example, in group theory. 
A quick proof (and some applications) can be found in the book \cite{MR1449137} of Herstein. 

% \subsection*{The Brauer group}

% The Brauer group is a helpful tool to classify division algebras over fields. It can also be defined in terms of Galois cohomology. 
% See \cite{MR1233388} for the definition and some properties. 

\subsection*{The Weyl algebra}

The Weyl algebra is the quotient of the free algebra on two generators
$X$ and $Y$ by the ideal generated by the element
$YX-XY-1$. The Weyl algebra is a simple ring that is 
not a matrix ring over a division ring. It is also a non-commutative domain and an Ore extension. See \cite{MR1838439} for more information. 
In 1968, Dixmier conjectured that any 
endomorphism of a Weyl algebra is an automorphism; the conjecture
is still open. 

\subsection*{The Jacobson--Herstein theorem}

There exist more theorems similar to 
the Jacobson's commutativity theorem; see \cite{MR1838439} and \cite{MR2319575}. For example, 
the Jacobson--Herstein theorem states that  
if $R$ is a ring
such that for every $x,y\in R$ there exists some
$n(x,y)\geq2$ such that 
\[
(xy-yx)^{n(x,y)}=xy-yx,
\]
then $R$ is commutative.

% % \subsection*{Dedekind-finite rings}

% % The idea is to develop the basic aspects of Dedekind-finite rings; see Appendix \ref{section:DedekindFinite}. 
% % A standard reference is Lam's book \cite{MR2278849}.

% %\subsection*{von Neumann regular rings}

% % \subsection*{The Skolem--Noether theorem}

% % Any automorphism of the full $n\times n$ matrix algebra 
% % is conjugation by some invertible $n\times n$ matrix. This is an elementary 
% % instance of the celebrated Skolem--Noether theorem. We refer to 
% % \cite[Chapter 4]{MR3308118} for the theorem 
% % and its proof (in a more general context).

% \subsection*{The double centralizer theorem}

% Let $R$ be a ring. 
% The \emph{centralizer} of a subring $S$ of $R$ 
% is 
% $C_R(S)=\{r\in R: rs=sr\text{ for all $s\in S$}\}$. 
% Clearly, $C_R(C_R(S))\supseteq S$, but equality does not always hold. 
% The double centralizer theorem give conditions under which one can conclude that the equality occurs; see \cite[Chapter 4]{MR3308118}.

% s_{n}(X_1,\dots,X_n)=\sum_{\sigma\in\Sym_n}\sgn(\sigma)X_{\sigma(1)}\cdots X_{\sigma(n)}.
% \]
% See \cite[Theorem 6.39]{MR3308118} for the beautiful

% for the basic theory of Ore's extensions. 

% \subsection*{Bi-ordered or left-ordered groups}

% Basic notions about ordered groups appear in the book
% of Passman \cite{MR798076}, where the motivation is based on 
% algebraic properties of group algebras. 

% \subsection*{The Golod--Shafarevich theorem}

% This is an important theorem of non-commutative algebra
% with several interesting applications, for example, in group theory. 
% A quick proof (and some applications) can be found in the book \cite{MR1449137} of Herstein.

% % The Brauer group is a helpful tool to classify division algebras over fields. It can also be defined in terms of Galois cohomology. 
% % See \cite{MR1233388} for the definition and some properties.

% In 1968, Dixmier conjectured that any 
% endomorphism of a Weyl algebra is an automorphism; the conjecture
% is still open. 

% % \subsection*{Passman's theorem}

% % The Kaplansky problems present several intriguing questions about group rings, with known logical interconnections among them. Passman's theorem states that if the group ring $K[G]$ of a torsion-free group
% % is reduced, then $K[G]$ is a domain (see Appendix \ref{section:Passman}).

% % \subsection*{Gardam's theorem}

% % Let $K$ be a field and $G$ be a torsion-free group. 
% % What do the units of $K[G]$ look like? The conjecture
% % is that units of $K[G]$ are of the form $\lambda g$ for
% % some $0\ne\lambda\in K$ and $g\in G$. Recently, 
% % Gardam \cite{MR4334981} found counterexamples; see Appendix \ref{section:Gardam} for the case where the field has positive characteristic. 
% % %The problem is still
% % %open for fields of characteristic zero.
